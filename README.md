# better_integral

A better integral helper component for Home Assistant.

e.g. for converting Watt readings to kWh.

Intended to produce reasonable values that match the area under the graph and not be tripped up by brief sensor unavailablity (e.g. restarts).

Based on https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/integration/
